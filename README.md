# GrowTree

GrowTree is a web3 platform for promoting tree planting and combating climate change. It uses blockchain technology, smart contracts, dynamic NFTs, and gamification to create a personalized and engaging experience for donors. 

## Features

- **Blockchain-based transparency and security**: GrowTree uses blockchain technology to ensure that all donations are transparently and securely tracked.
